# Commodore Commander

A set of plugin-ins to the Eclipse IDE that adds support for building Commodore 64 applications using the Kick Assembler for the MOS 6510 processor. It currently have the following features:

* Editor based on the 6502 TextMate grammar
* Tooltips for 6510 mnemonics
* Tooltips for the Commodore 64 memory map
* Automatic compilation when a file has changed
* Problem markers when a compilation produces errors
* Launch the Vice emulator when double clicking a *.prg file

It is currently not usable in standalone form. You are better off starting it in debug mode from the Eclipse instance used to build it.
